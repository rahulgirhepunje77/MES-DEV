VPC ( Virtual private Cloud )

What is VPC :- 

VPC is a logically isolated virtual network in AWS that allows us to securely deploy cloud resources with complete control over networking, security, routing, and connectivity. It enables scalable, secure, and production-grade architectures.

CIDR ( Classless Inter-Domain Routing )
It is a method to define IP address ranges in networking and cloud platforms like AWS VPC, Kubernetes, and on-prem networks.

Before CIDR, IPs were divided into fixed classes (A, B, C).
This caused IP wastage and poor scalability.

CIDR solves this by:

Allowing flexible IP ranges

Efficient IP utilization

Better network planning

10.0.0.0/16 65,536 IPS

For every subnet, AWS reserves 5 IP addresses: Network address, VPC router,Future use,Broadcast

Subnet:-
VPC = Big network
Subnet = Smaller pieces of that network

Each subnet:

Belongs to one VPC

Exists in one Availability Zone (AZ)

Uses a portion of the VPC CIDR

🔹 Public Subnet

A subnet is public if:

It has a route to Internet Gateway (IGW)

Instances can get public IPs

Used for:

Load Balancers (ALB/NLB)

Bastion Hosts

NAT Gateway

🔹 Private Subnet

A subnet is private if:

No direct route to IGW

Internet access via NAT Gateway (optional)

Used for:

Application servers

EKS worker nodes

Databases (RDS)

Internet Gatway:- 

Internet Gateway = Door between your VPC and the Internet

Route Table:-

Subnet is public or private based on route table only
Route Table = Traffic direction map for a subnet
